# FIT-FOR-ALL
Though covid helped us realize that health is the most important thing we have, If a person suffer illness it effects his household catastrophically. We aim to add a BMI tracker based on ML so it could track your BMI and tell you how you should consume your food and workout. And if your BMI is not good then immediately an appointment is set with a dietician to guide the individual to lead a healthy life.We also aim at adding a feature where the site would detect the location and display it in the native language of the user and also add a feature where it would use the loaction to find the doctors or dieticians available near them.

## What it does
The Fit For ALL provide you a smart calorie prediction using ML which predicts the amount of calories burned during the workout in real time along with how much calories you consumed. It also prove a smart BMI calculator through which you can calculate your BMI and also suggest you proper diet, and calories according to your BMI and you can also made it easier for you to book an appoinrment. The platform has a smart chatbot for your assistant and also available in multiple langusges.
